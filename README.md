# @cozy-finance/platform-ids

Cozy Finance is an open-source protocol for automated and trust-minimized protection markets.

When deploying a protection market, developers can supply an array of `platformIds` in order to associate that market with the platforms its related to. These `platformIds` can be used by front-ends in order to properly display, group and sort markets.

This repo contains the `platformIds` currently supported currently recognized in the Cozy ecosystem. Please submit a PR if you would like to list a new platform in support of a protection market you plan to deploy.
